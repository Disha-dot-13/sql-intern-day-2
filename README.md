We created the Superstore_Sales table and inserted both complete and incomplete records to simulate real retail data. To handle missing information, we altered specific columns to allow NULL values and then cleaned the dataset by updating NULL text fields with labels like “Unknown,” numeric fields with values such as 0, and date fields with a default date. We also used UPDATE statements to correct data, DELETE statements to remove unwanted or invalid rows, and WHERE conditions to filter and analyze the records based on city, sales amount, profit, or missing values. Through these operations, we practiced the essential SQL skills for data preparation, cleaning, and querying.
